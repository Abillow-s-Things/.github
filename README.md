# Abillow's Things

Hello! This is an organization for stuff that I make! Not all of it is public, and development is typically private. 

Currently, I focus on things that are related to Slimes. If you didn't know, Slime is an full body tracking solution that is meant to be affordable. 
I own and run the Affordable Quality Slime Project. The goal of this is to make Slimes that are highly affordable and still of quality. There will be several varients of them, once developed. I will likely end up making 6 varients, an BMI270, LSM6DSO (or DSV, though unlikely), ICM45686, and mags with all of those. These will be lisensed openly, though, I will personally write the lisense.
